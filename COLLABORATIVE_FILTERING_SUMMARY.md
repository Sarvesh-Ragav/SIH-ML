## 🔄 Integration with Content-Based

### Hybrid Recommendation Formula
```python
# Combine CF and content-based scores
hybrid_score = α * cf_score + (1-α) * content_score
# Recommended: α = 0.4 (40% CF, 60% content)

# Benefits:
• Content-based: Handles cold start, explainable
• CF: Captures patterns, increases diversity
• Hybrid: Best of both worlds
```

### Ready for Production
```python
# Real-time recommendation serving
def get_hybrid_recommendations(student_id, top_k=5):
    cf_scores = load_cf_scores(student_id)
    content_scores = load_content_scores(student_id)
    hybrid_scores = 0.4 * cf_scores + 0.6 * content_scores
    return top_k_recommendations(hybrid_scores)
```
